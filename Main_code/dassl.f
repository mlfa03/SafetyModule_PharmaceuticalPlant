C
C *Arguments:
C
C  RES:EXT  This is a subroutine which you provide to define the
C           differential/algebraic system.
C
C  NEQ:IN  This is the number of equations to be solved.
C
C  T:INOUT  This is the current value of the independent variable.
C
C  Y(*):INOUT  This array contains the solution components at T.
C
C  YPRIME(*):INOUT  This array contains the derivatives of the solution
C                   components at T.
C
C  TOUT:IN  This is a point at which a solution is desired.
C
C  INFO(N):IN  The basic task of the code is to solve the system from T
C              to TOUT and return an answer at TOUT.  INFO is an integer
C              array which is used to communicate exactly how you want
C              this task to be carried out.  N must be greater than or
C              equal to 15.
C
C  RTOL,ATOL:INOUT  These quantities represent absolute and relative
C                   error tolerances which you provide to indicate how
C                   accurately you wish the solution to be computed.
C                   You may choose them to be both scalars or else
C                   both vectors.
C
C  IDID:OUT  This scalar quantity is an indicator reporting what the
C            code did.  You must monitor this integer variable to decide
C            what action to take next.
C
C   :WORK  A real work array of length LRW which provides the
C               code with needed storage space.
C
C  LRW:IN  The length of RWORK.
C
C  IWORK:WORK  An integer work array of length LIW which probides the
C               code with needed storage space.
C
C  LIW:IN  The length of IWORK.
C
C  RPAR,IPAR:IN  These are real and integer parameter arrays which
C                you can use for communication between your calling
C                program and the RES subroutine (and the JAC subroutine)
C
C  JAC:EXT  This is the name of a subroutine which you may choose to
C           provide for defining a matrix of partial derivatives
C           described below.
C

C *Description
C  QUANTITIES WHICH MAY BE ALTERED BY THE CODE ARE
C     T,Y(*),YPRIME(*),INFO(1),RTOL,ATOL,
C     IDID,RWORK(*) AND IWORK(*)
C
C  Subroutine DDASSL uses the backward differentiation formulas of
C  orders one through five to solve a system of the above form for Y and
C  YPRIME.  Values for Y and YPRIME at the initial time must be given as
C  input.  These values must be consistent, (that is, if T,Y,YPRIME are
C  the given initial values, they must satisfy G(T,Y,YPRIME) = 0.).  The
C  subroutine solves the system from T to TOUT.  It is easy to continue
C  the solution to get results at additional TOUT.  This is the interval
C  mode of operation.  Intermediate results can also be obtained easily
C  by using the intermediate-output capability.
C
C  ----------INPUT-WHAT TO DO ON THE FIRST CALL TO DDASSL---------------
C
C
C  The first call of the code is defined to be the start of each new
C  problem. Read through the descriptions of all the following items,
C  provide sufficient storage space for designated arrays, set
C  appropriate variables for the initialization of the problem, and
C  give information about how you want the problem to be solved.
C
C
C  RES -- Provide a subroutine of the form
C             SUBROUTINE RES(T,Y,YPRIME,DELTA,IRES,RPAR,IPAR)
C         to define the system of differential/algebraic
C         equations which is to be solved. For the given values
C         of T,Y and YPRIME, the subroutine should
C         return the residual of the defferential/algebraic
C         system
C             DELTA = G(T,Y,YPRIME)
C         (DELTA(*) is a vector of length NEQ which is
C         output for RES.)
C
C         Subroutine RES must not alter T,Y or YPRIME.
C         You must declare the name RES in an external
C         statement in your program that calls DDASSL.
C         You must dimension Y,YPRIME and DELTA in RES.
C
C         IRES is an integer flag which is always equal to
C         zero on input. Subroutine RES should alter IRES
C         only if it encounters an illegal value of Y or
C         a stop condition. Set IRES = -1 if an input value
C         is illegal, and DDASSL will try to solve the problem
C         without getting IRES = -1. If IRES = -2, DDASSL
C         will return control to the calling program
C         with IDID = -11.
C
C         RPAR and IPAR are real and integer parameter arrays which
C         you can use for communication between your calling program
C         and subroutine RES. They are not altered by DDASSL. If you
C         do not need RPAR or IPAR, ignore these parameters by treat-
C         ing them as dummy arguments. If you do choose to use them,
C         dimension them in your calling program and in RES as arrays
C         of appropriate length.
C
C  NEQ -- Set it to the number of differential equations.
C         (NEQ .GE. 1)
C
C  T -- Set it to the initial point of the integration.
C       T must be defined as a variable.
C
C  Y(*) -- Set this vector to the initial values of the NEQ solution
C          components at the initial point. You must dimension Y of
C          length at least NEQ in your calling program.
C
C  YPRIME(*) -- Set this vector to the initial values of
C               the NEQ first derivatives of the solution
C               components at the initial point. You
C               must dimension YPRIME at least NEQ
C               in your calling program. If you do not
C               know initial values of some of the solution
C               components, see the explanation of INFO(11).
C
C  TOUT - Set it to the first point at which a solution
C         is desired. You can not take TOUT = T.
C         integration either forward in T (TOUT .GT. T) or
C         backward in T (TOUT .LT. T) is permitted.
C
C         The code advances the solution from T to TOUT using
C         step sizes which are automatically selected so as to
C         achieve the desired accuracy. If you wish, the code will
C         return with the solution and its derivative at
C         intermediate steps (intermediate-output mode) so that
C         you can monitor them, but you still must provide TOUT in
C         accord with the basic aim of the code.
C
C         the first step taken by the code is a critical one
C         because it must reflect how fast the solution changes near
C         the initial point. The code automatically selects an
C         initial step size which is practically always suitable for
C         the problem. By using the fact that the code will not step
C         past TOUT in the first step, you could, if necessary,
C         restrict the length of the initial step size.
C
C         For some problems it may not be permissable to integrate
C         past a point TSTOP because a discontinuity occurs there
C         or the solution or its derivative is not defined beyond
C         TSTOP. When you have declared a TSTOP point (SEE INFO(4)
C         and RWORK(1)), you have told the code not to integrate
C         past TSTOP. In this case any TOUT beyond TSTOP is invalid
C         input.
C
C  INFO(*) - Use the INFO array to give the code more details about
C            how you want your problem solved. This array should be
C            dimensioned of length 15, though DDASSL uses
C            only the first eleven entries. You must respond to all of
C            the following items which are arranged as questions. The
C            simplest use of the code corresponds to answering all
C            questions as yes, i.e. setting all entries of INFO to 0.
C
C       INFO(1) - This parameter enables the code to initialize
C              itself. You must set it to indicate the start of every
C              new problem.
C
C          **** Is this the first call for this problem ...
C                Yes - Set INFO(1) = 0
C                 No - Not applicable here.
C                      See below for continuation calls.  ****
C
C       INFO(2) - How much accuracy you want of your solution
C              is specified by the error tolerances RTOL and ATOL.
C              The simplest use is to take them both to be scalars.
C              To obtain more flexibility, they can both be vectors.
C              The code must be told your choice.
C
C          **** Are both error tolerances RTOL, ATOL scalars ...
C                Yes - Set INFO(2) = 0
C                      and input scalars for both RTOL and ATOL
C                 No - Set INFO(2) = 1
C                      and input arrays for both RTOL and ATOL ****
C
C       INFO(3) - The code integrates from T in the direction
C              of TOUT by steps. If you wish, it will return the
C              computed solution and derivative at the next
C              intermediate step (the intermediate-output mode) or
C              TOUT, whichever comes first. This is a good way to
C              proceed if you want to see the behavior of the solution.
C              If you must have solutions at a great many specific
C              TOUT points, this code will compute them efficiently.
C
C          **** Do you want the solution only at
C                TOUT (and not at the next intermediate step) ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(3) = 0
C                  No - Set INFO(3) = 1 ****
C
C       INFO(4) - To handle solutions at a great many specific
C              values TOUT efficiently, this code may integrate past
C              TOUT and interpolate to obtain the result at TOUT.
C              Sometimes it is not possible to integrate beyond some
C              point TSTOP because the equation changes there or it is
C              not defined past TSTOP. Then you must tell the code
C              not to go past.
C
C           **** Can the integration be carried out without any
C                restrictions on the independent variable T ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(4)=0
C                  No - Set INFO(4)=1
C                       and define the stopping point TSTOP by
C                       setting RWORK(1)=TSTOP ****
C
C       INFO(5) - To solve differential/algebraic problems it is
C              necessary to use a matrix of partial derivatives of the
C              system of differential equations. If you do not
C              provide a subroutine to evaluate it analytically (see
C              description of the item JAC in the call list), it will
C              be approximated by numerical differencing in this code.
C              although it is less trouble for you to have the code
C              compute partial derivatives by numerical differencing,
C              the solution will be more reliable if you provide the
C              derivatives via JAC. Sometimes numerical differencing
C              is cheaper than evaluating derivatives in JAC and
C              sometimes it is not - this depends on your problem.
C
C           **** Do you want the code to evaluate the partial
C                derivatives automatically by numerical differences ...
C                   Yes - Set INFO(5)=0
C                    No - Set INFO(5)=1
C                  and provide subroutine JAC for evaluating the
C                  matrix of partial derivatives ****
C
C       INFO(6) - DDASSL will perform much better if the matrix of
C              partial derivatives, DG/DY + CJ*DG/DYPRIME,
C              (here CJ is a scalar determined by DDASSL)
C              is banded and the code is told this. In this
C              case, the storage needed will be greatly reduced,
C              numerical differencing will be performed much cheaper,
C              and a number of important algorithms will execute much
C              faster. The differential equation is said to have
C              half-bandwidths ML (lower) and MU (upper) if equation i
C              involves only unknowns Y(J) with
C                             I-ML .LE. J .LE. I+MU
C              for all I=1,2,...,NEQ. Thus, ML and MU are the widths
C              of the lower and upper parts of the band, respectively,
C              with the main diagonal being excluded. If you do not
C              indicate that the equation has a banded matrix of partial
C              derivatives, the code works with a full matrix of NEQ**2
C              elements (stored in the conventional way). Computations
C              with banded matrices cost less time and storage than with
C              full matrices if 2*ML+MU .LT. NEQ. If you tell the
C              code that the matrix of partial derivatives has a banded
C              structure and you want to provide subroutine JAC to
C              compute the partial derivatives, then you must be careful
C              to store the elements of the matrix in the special form
C              indicated in the description of JAC.
C
C          **** Do you want to solve the problem using a full
C               (dense) matrix (and not a special banded
C               structure) ...
C                Yes - Set INFO(6)=0
C                 No - Set INFO(6)=1
C                       and provide the lower (ML) and upper (MU)
C                       bandwidths by setting
C                       IWORK(1)=ML
C                       IWORK(2)=MU ****
C
C
C        INFO(7) -- You can specify a maximum (absolute value of)
C              stepsize, so that the code
C              will avoid passing over very
C              large regions.
C
C          ****  Do you want the code to decide
C                on its own maximum stepsize?

C              about the scaling of your problem, you can

C   RTOL, ATOL -- You must assign relative (RTOL) and absolute (ATOL
C               error tolerances to tell the code how accurately you

C               in either case all components must be non-negative.
C
C               The tolerances are used by the code in a local error
C               test at each step which requires roughly that
C                     ABS(LOCAL ERROR) .LE. RTOL*ABS(Y)+ATOL
C               for each vector component.
C               (More specifically, a root-mean-square norm is used to
C               measure the size of vectors, and the error test uses the
C               magnitude of the solution at the beginning of the step.)
C
C               the true (global) error is the difference between the
C               true solution of the initial value problem and the
C               computed approximation. Practically all present day
C               codes, including this one, control the local error at
C               each step and do not even attempt to control the global
C               error directly.
C               Usually, but not always, the true accuracy of the
C               computed Y is comparable to the error tolerances. This
C               code will usually, but not always, deliver a more
C               accurate solution if you reduce the tolerances and
C               integrate again. By comparing two such solutions you
C               can get a fairly reliable idea of the true error in the
C               solution at the bigger tolerances.
C
C               Setting ATOL=0. results in a pure relative error test on
C               that component. Setting RTOL=0. results in a pure
C               absolute error test on that component. A mixed test
C               with non-zero RTOL and ATOL corresponds roughly to a
C               relative error test when the solution component is much
C               bigger than ATOL and to an absolute error test when the
C               solution component is smaller than the threshhold ATOL.
C
C               The code will not attempt to compute a solution at an
C               accuracy unreasonable for the machine being used. It
C               will advise you if you ask for too much accuracy and
C               inform you as to the maximum accuracy it believes
C               possible.

C               your calling program.
C
C  LIW -- Set it to the declared length of the IWORK array.
C               you must have LIW .GE. 20+NEQ
C
C  RPAR, IPAR -- These are parameter arrays, of real and integer
C               type, respectively. You can use them for communication
C               between your program that calls DDASSL and the
C               RES subroutine (and the JAC subroutine). They are not
C               altered by DDASSL. If you do not need RPAR or IPAR,
C               ignore these parameters by treating them as dummy
C               arguments. If you do choose to use them, dimension
C               them in your calling program and in RES (and in JAC)
C               as arrays of appropriate length.
C
C  JAC -- If you have set INFO(5)=0, you can ignore this parameter
C               by treating it as a dummy argument. Otherwise, you must
C               provide a subroutine of the form
C               JAC(T,Y,YPRIME,PD,CJ,RPAR,IPAR)
C               to define the matrix of partial derivatives
C               PD=DG/DY+CJ*DG/DYPRIME
C               CJ is a scalar which is input to JAC.
C               For the given values of T,Y,YPRIME, the
C               subroutine must evaluate the non-zero partial
C               derivatives for each equation and each solution
C               component, and store these values in the
C               matrix PD. The elements of PD are set to zero
C               before each call to JAC so only non-zero elements
C               need to be defined.
C
C               Subroutine JAC must not alter T,Y,(*),YPRIME(*), or CJ.
C               You must declare the name JAC in an
C               EXTERNAL STATEMENT in your program that calls
C               DDASSL. You must dimension Y, YPRIME and PD
C               in JAC.
C
C               The way you must store the elements into the PD matrix
C               depends on the structure of the matrix which you
C               indicated by INFO(6).
C               *** INFO(6)=0 -- Full (dense) matrix ***
C                   Give PD a first dimension of NEQ.
C                   When you evaluate the (non-zero) partial derivative
C                   of equation I with respect to variable J, you must
C                   store it in PD according to
C                   PD(I,J) = * DG(I)/DY(J)+CJ*DG(I)/DYPRIME(J)*
C               *** INFO(6)=1 -- Banded JACOBIAN with ML lower and MU
C                   upper diagonal bands (refer to INFO(6) description
C                   of ML and MU) ***
C                   Give PD a first dimension of 2*ML+MU+1.
C                   when you evaluate the (non-zero) partial derivative
C                   of equation I with respect to variable J, you must
C                   store it in PD according to
C                   IROW = I - J + ML + MU + 1
C                   PD(IROW,J) = *DG(I)/DY(J)+CJ*DG(I)/DYPRIME(J)*
C               RPAR and IPAR are real and integer parameter arrays
C               which you can use for communication between your calling
C               program and your JACOBIAN subroutine JAC. They are not
C               altered by DDASSL. If you do not need RPAR or IPAR,
C               ignore these parameters by treating them as dummy
C               arguments. If you do choose to use them, dimension
C               them in your calling program and in JAC as arrays of
C               appropriate length.
C
C
C
C  OPTIONALLY REPLACEABLE NORM ROUTINE:
C  DDASSL uses a weighted norm DDANRM to measure the size
C  of vectors such as the estimated error in each step.
C  A FUNCTION subprogram
C    DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION DDANRM(NEQ,V,WT,RPAR,IPAR)
C    DIMENSION V(NEQ),WT(NEQ)
C  is used to define this norm. Here, V is the vector
C  whose norm is to be computed, and WT is a vector of
C  weights.  A DDANRM routine has been included with DDASSL
C  which computes the weighted root-mean-square norm
C  given by
C    DDANRM=SQRT((1/NEQ)*SUM(V(I)/WT(I))**2)
C  this norm is suitable for most problems. In some
C  special cases, it may be more convenient and/or
C  efficient to define your own norm by writing a function
C  subprogram to be called instead of DDANRM. This should
C  ,however, be attempted only after careful thought and
C  consideration.
C
C
C------OUTPUT-AFTER ANY RETURN FROM DDASSL----
C
C  The principal aim of the code is to return a computed solution at
C  TOUT, although it is also possible to obtain intermediate results
C  along the way. To find out whether the code achieved its goal
C  or if the integration process was interrupted before the task was
C  completed, you must check the IDID parameter.
C
C
C   T -- The solution was successfully advanced to the
C               output value of T.
C
C   Y(*) -- Contains the computed solution approximation at T.
C
C   YPRIME(*) -- Contains the computed derivative
C               approximation at T.
C
C   IDID -- Reports what the code did.
C
C                     *** Task completed ***
C                Reported by positive values of IDID
C
C           IDID = 1 -- A step was successfully taken in the
C                   intermediate-output mode. The code has not
C                   yet reached TOUT.
C
C           IDID = 2 -- The integration to TOUT was successfully
C                   completed (T=TOUT) by stepping exactly to TOUT.
C
C           IDID = 3 -- The integration to TOUT was successfully
C                   completed (T=TOUT) by stepping past TOUT.
C                   Y(*) is obtained by interpolation.
C                   YPRIME(*) is obtained by interpolation.
C
C                    *** Task interrupted ***
C                Reported by negative values of IDID
C
C           IDID = -1 -- A large amount of work has been expended.
C                   (About 500 steps)
C
C           IDID = -2 -- The error tolerances are too stringent.
C
C           IDID = -3 -- The local error test cannot be satisfied
C                   because you specified a zero component in ATOL
C                   and the corresponding computed solution
C                   component is zero. Thus, a pure relative error
C                   test is impossible for this component.
C
C           IDID = -6 -- DDASSL had repeated error test
C                   failures on the last attempted step.
C
C           IDID = -7 -- The corrector could not converge.
C
C           IDID = -8 -- The matrix of partial derivatives
C                   is singular.
C
C           IDID = -9 -- The corrector could not converge.
C                   there were repeated error test failures
C                   in this step.
C
C           IDID =-10 -- The corrector could not converge
C                   because IRES was equal to minus one.
C
C           IDID =-11 -- IRES equal to -2 was encountered
C                   and control is being returned to the
C                   calling program.
C
C           IDID =-12 -- DDASSL failed to compute the initial
C                   YPRIME.
C
C
C
C           IDID = -13,..,-32 -- Not applicable for this code
C
C                    *** Task terminated ***
C                Reported by the value of IDID=-33
C
C           IDID = -33 -- The code has encountered trouble from which
C                   it cannot recover. A message is printed
C                   explaining the trouble and control is returned
C                   to the calling program. For example, this occurs
C                   when invalid input is detected.
C
C   RTOL, ATOL -- These quantities remain unchanged except when
C               IDID = -2. In this case, the error tolerances have been
C               increased by the code to values which are estimated to
C               be appropriate for continuing the integration. However,
C               the reported solution at T was obtained using the input
C               values of RTOL and ATOL.
C
C   RWORK, IWORK -- Contain information which is usually of no
C               interest to the user but necessary for subsequent calls.
C               However, you may find use for

C                       integration has reached. This will be different
C                       from T only when interpolation has been
C                       performed (IDID=3).

C
C   INPUT -- What to do to continue the integration
C            (calls after the first)                **
C
C     This code is organized so that subsequent calls to continue the
C     integration involve little (if any) additional effort on your
C     part. You must monitor the IDID parameter in order to determine
C     what to do next.
C
C     Recalling that the principal task of the code is to integrate
C     from T to TOUT (the interval mode), usually all you will need
C     to do is specify a new TOUT upon reaching the current TOUT.
C
C     Do not alter any quantity not specifically permitted below,
C     in particular do not alter NEQ,T,Y(*),YPRIME(*),RWORK(*),IWORK(*)
C     or the differential equation in subroutine RES. Any such
C     alteration constitutes a new problem and must be treated as such,
C     i.e., you must start afresh.
C
C     You cannot change from vector to scalar error control or vice
C     versa (INFO(2)), but you can change the size of the entries of
C     RTOL, ATOL. Increasing a tolerance makes the equation easier
C     to integrate. Decreasing a tolerance will make the equation
C     harder to integrate and should generally be avoided.
C
C     You can switch from the intermediate-output mode to the
C     interval mode (INFO(3)) or vice versa at any time.
C
C     If it has been necessary to prevent the integration from going
C     past a point TSTOP (INFO(4), RWORK(1)), keep in mind that the
C     code will not integrate to any TOUT beyond the currently
C     specified TSTOP. Once TSTOP has been reached you must change
C     the value of TSTOP or set INFO(4)=0. You may change INFO(4)
C     or TSTOP at any time but you must supply the value of TSTOP in
C     RWORK(1) whenever you set INFO(4)=1.
C
C     Do not change INFO(5), INFO(6), IWORK(1), or IWORK(2)
C     unless you are going to restart the code.
C
C                    *** Following a completed task ***
C     If
C     IDID = 1, call the code again to continue the integration
C                  another step in the direction of TOUT.
C
C     IDID = 2 or 3, define a new TOUT and call the code again.
C                  TOUT must be different from T. You cannot change
C                  the direction of integration without restarting.
C
C                    *** Following an interrupted task ***
C                  To show the code that you realize the task was
C                  interrupted and that you want to continue, you
C                  must take appropriate action and set INFO(1) = 1
C     If
C     IDID = -1, The code has taken about 500 steps.
C                  If you want to continue, set INFO(1) = 1 and
C                  call the code again. An additional 500 steps
C                  will be allowed.
C
C     IDID = -2, The error tolerances RTOL, ATOL have been
C                  increased to values the code estimates appropriate
C                  for continuing. You may want to change them
C                  yourself. If you are sure you want to continue
C                  with relaxed error tolerances, set INFO(1)=1 and
C                  call the code again.
C
C     IDID = -3, A solution component is zero and you set the
C                  corresponding component of ATOL to zero. If you
C                  are sure you want to continue, you must first
C                  alter the error criterion to use positive values
C                  for those components of ATOL corresponding to zero
C                  solution components, then set INFO(1)=1 and call
C                  the code again.
C
C     IDID = -4,-5  --- Cannot occur with this code.
C
C     IDID = -6, Repeated error test failures occurred on the
C                  last attempted step in DDASSL. A singularity in the
C                  solution may be present. If you are absolutely
C                  certain you want to continue, you should restart
C                  the integration. (Provide initial values of Y and
C                  YPRIME which are consistent)
C
C     IDID = -7, Repeated convergence test failures occurred
C                  on the last attempted step in DDASSL. An inaccurate
C                  or ill-conditioned JACOBIAN may be the problem. If
C                  you are absolutely certain you want to continue, you
C                  should restart the integration.
C
C     IDID = -8, The matrix of partial derivatives is singular.
C                  Some of your equations may be redundant.
C                  DDASSL cannot solve the problem as stated.
C                  It is possible that the redundant equations
C                  could be removed, and then DDASSL could
C                  solve the problem. It is also possible
C                  that a solution to your problem either
C                  does not exist or is not unique.
C

C                  failures, preceeded by multiple error
C                  test failures, on the last attempted step.
C                  It is possible that your problem
C                  is ill-posed, and cannot be solved
C                  using this code. Or, there may be a
C                  discontinuity or a singularity in the
C                  solution. If you are absolutely certain
C                  you want to continue, you should restart
C                  the integration.
C
C    IDID =-10, DDASSL had multiple convergence test failures
C                  because IRES was equal to minus one.
C                  If you are absolutely certain you want
C                  to continue, you should restart the
C                  integration.
C
C    IDID =-11, IRES=-2 was encountered, and control is being
C                  returned to the calling program.
C
C    IDID =-12, DDASSL failed to compute the initial YPRIME.
C               This could happen because the initial
C               approximation to YPRIME was not very good, or
C               if a YPRIME consistent with the initial Y
C               does not exist. The problem could also be caused
C               by an inaccurate or singular iteration matrix.

C     IDID = -13,..,-32 --- Cannot occur with this code.
C
C                       *** Following a terminated task ***
C     If IDID= -33, you cannot continue the solution of this
C                  problem. An attempt to do so will result in your
C                  run being terminated.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Subroutine XERRWV, as given here, constitutes a simplified version of
C the SLATEC error handling package.
C Written by A. C. Hindmarsh and P. N. Brown at LLNL.
C Modified 1/8/90 by Clement Ulrich at LLNL.
C Version of 8 January, 1990.
C This version is in double precision.
C
C All arguments are input arguments.
C
C MSG    = The message (character array).
C NMES   = The length of MSG (number of characters).
C NERR   = The error number (not used).
C LEVEL  = The error level..
C          0 or 1 means recoverable (control returns to caller).
C          2 means fatal (run is aborted--see note below).
C NI     = Number of integers (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
C I1,I2  = Integers to be printed, depending on NI.
C NR     = Number of reals (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
C R1,R2  = Reals to be printed, depending on NR.
C
C Note..  this routine is compatible with ANSI-77; however the
C following assumptions may not be valid for some machines:
C
C 1. The argument MSG is assumed to be of type CHARACTER, and
C    the message is printed with a format of (1X,80A1).
C 2. The message is assumed to take only one line.
C    Multi-line messages are generated by repeated calls.
C 3. If LEVEL = 2, control passes to the statement STOP
C    to abort the run.  For a different run-abort command,
C    change the statement following statement 100 at the end.
C 4. R1 and R2 are assumed to be in double precision and are printed
C    in E21.13 format.
C 5. The logical unit number 6 is standard output.
C    For a different default logical unit number, change the assignment
C    statement for LUNIT below.
